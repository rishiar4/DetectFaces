# DetectFaces
It detects the number of faces in a image.

The Program works on detecting the face using HaarClassifiers and trained XML sheets .
It is based on CV and runs on detecting the face and to assure the detection is true , i have used eye detection here too, When you provide it with an image path , it runs and provides with the number of faces in an image.
